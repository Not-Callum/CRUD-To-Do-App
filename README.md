This is a To-Do app I created to learn SQL, .NET, CRUD functions and C#. The inspiration is based around my previous project of an "RPG" task project. In this app you: create task(s), update them to be completed, and even make them a "Permanent Task".
The permanent task function means that with every new day, those functions that are labelled as "PermaTask" will remain whilst any other task will be deleted, giving you a fresh start to your day. On a new day, all your remaining permanent tasks will be automatically
uncompleted. As you complete your tasks, a progress bar fills up simulating a "health bar". When you click on a cell in the data grid (where your tasks appear), it will automatically fill the search bar so you do not have to type the task name into the search bar. If I was to continue this project, I would merge the "experience" functions (a function to give you "experience points" for each completed task at the end of a day) and also add
rewards that can be won by completing all tasks.
